.sp
d, i         The 
.I int 
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.sp
o, u, x, X   The 
.I int 
unsigned int
argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.
.sp
c             The 
.I int 
argument is converted to an unsigned char and the result character is printed.
.sp
s             The
